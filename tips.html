            <h2>Tips, Tricks, and Helpful Info</h2>
            <p>
                Seeing as <b>Brilliant Diamond</b> and <b>Shining Pearl</b> are
                remakes of games from well over a decade ago they don't follow the
                modern design of the recent Pokémon games
                <b>(Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!</b>,<b>Sword and Shield)</b>, while some quality of life
                changes have been made to make the
                experience better, something's have remained the same. Although the
                things that have remained the same are to be expected really seeing as
                they are areas/zones of the game and not something as simple as User
                Interface tweak to make navigating Sinnoh easier.

                <h4>Type Advantages</h4>
                <p>
                    Like all games in the series, type-advantages play a major part in
                    how easy your journey in the Sinnoh region will be. This is made
                    easier now with the addition of text under each of your Pokémon's
                    abilities stating their effectiveness, however this text is only
                    present the second time you encounter that specific Pokémon, the
                    first time you face the Pokémon you will need to either consult an
                    external tool to get its type and moves are effective against it or
                    you may just have this knowledge already from playing previous
                    games. If you want an external tool to keep open and help with this
                    I suggest this
                    <a href="https://www.pkmn.help/defense/?types=normal" target="_blank"><b>Type Calculator</b></a>.

                <h4>Mystery Gifts</h4>
                <p>
                    <b>Mystery Gifts</b> are gifts given out sometimes by the Pokémon
                    Company as rewards for players. Once you have acquired your first
                    gym badges you unlock the ability to receive gifts. The Mystery Gift
                    menu can be accessed by pressing the "<b>X</b>" button on the switch
                    and then selecting the bottom right option.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are various things that can be given out through
                    <b>Mystery Gifts</b>, most frequently things such as Poké Balls will
                    be given out and sometimes Pokémon will be given out and even rarer
                    than that is when <strong>Shiny</strong> Pokémon are given to
                    players through Mystery Gifts.

                <h4>Useful TM's, You May Have Missed</h4>
                <p>
                    There are a couple TM's <i>(formally HMs)</i> that are needed to
                    traverse the Sinnoh region and while you will naturally come across
                    most of the ones you need you could easily miss out a few key ones.

                <h4>Poké Balls</h4>
                <p>
                    They are many different kind of Poké Balls present in the game, each
                    with its own <em>effect</em>. Using the correct ball for the given
                    scenario will potentially save you from losing out a Pokémon you
                    were trying to catch but got away before you could successfully
                    catch it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each Pokémon will have a different
                    <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Catch_rate" target="_blank"><b>Catch Rate</b></a>
                    when compared to another so using the correct Poké Ball for the
                    situation can be crucial for catching the Pokémon before it faints
                    or runs away.
