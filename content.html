            <p>
                In Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, the
                <b>Grand Underground</b> is a special area made up of a series of
                tunnels located beneath the Sinnoh region.
            </p>
            <p>
                It must first be unlocked before a player can access the area. This
                cam be done once you reach Eterna City. Enter the house to the right
                of the Pokémon Center and the speak to the old man inside, he will
                give you the <b>Explorer Kit</b>, a <i>Key Item</i> that allows access
                to the <b>Grand Underground</b> from anywhere as long as you are
                outside in the open. Upon use of the <b>Explorer Kit</b> you will end
                up at the corresponding location in the
                <b>Grand Underground</b> compared to your location in the overworld.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>Grand Underground</b> is larger than its generation 4
                counter-part, and corresponds with the entire overworld map of Sinnoh.
            </p>
            <p>
                While in the Underground you can encounter walls that will sparkle
                that can be dug up by the player. Interacting with such a wall
                initiates a mini-game, where can be rewarded with rare items upon
                completion. Some of these items are only available from this source.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also present in the Underground are <b>Pokémon Hideaways</b> are new
                places to encounter Wild Pokémon, some of the Pokémon can only be
                found in Hideaways. All Pokémon found in these new areas will have at
                least one
                <b>Egg Move</b>
                if applicable. The strength and variety of Pokémon found in Hideaways
                will increase as you make progress on your journey to becoming the
                Champion of the Pokémon League. Each of the six areas found in the
                Underground will contain at least one large Hideaway.

                out of bog you need to move around the analog sticks on the switch but
                this does use up your valuable steps inside the Marsh. It is best to
                do what you can to avoid stepping in bogs.

                helpful when you are looking for specific Pokémon.
