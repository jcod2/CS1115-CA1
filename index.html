            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my Quick-Start guide and comparison for
                <b>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond</b> and <b>Shining Pearl</b>. Released on
                the 19<sup>th</sup> of November 2021 for the Nintendo Switch, these
                releases are remakes of the Generation IV games Diamond and Pearl,
                originally released on the 27<sup>th</sup> of July 2007 (Europe) for
                the Nintendo DS.

            <h2>Changes from the Originals</h2>
            <p>
                Unlike their originals, these new versions feature a new area called
                <b>Ramanas Park</b> an area which will let the player catch
                <i>Legendary</i> Pokémon from the previous games, it is only
                accessible after reaching the post game (after beating the elite
                four). Each game will have its own pool of
                <i>Legendary</i>
                Pokémon for the player to catch from.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many quality of life updates have been made seeing as the this point
                the original games have been out for nearly 15 years, and since then
                the games themselves have evolved with each new release. HMs have been
                more or less removed, now instead of needing to teach it your Pokémon
                with the requirements needed, now you use HMs from an app on your
                Pokétech. Any of the HMs present in the original games have now been
                made into TMs that you can teach your Pokémon for use in battle.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>Underground</b> has been expanded into the
                <b>Grand Underground</b>, it now has <i>six</i> areas compared to the
                originals games <i>four</i>. Players will now be able to encounter
                Pokémon in the grand underground, areas known as
                <b>Pokémon Hideaways</b> are now present and have different natural
                biomes, some Pokémon will only be available through these areas. Even
                Pokémon not normally found in the Sinnoh region can now be found in
                these Hideaways.

            <h2>Starter Pokémon</h2>
            <p>
                The three starter Pokémon for the <b>Sinnoh</b> region are
                <b>Turtwig</b>, <b>Chimchar</b> and <b>Piplup</b>. They are Grass,
                Fire and Water type respectively. While you will be fine with any
                stater, there advantages and disadvantages for each one. Turtwig is
                probably the best early option for the easiest start to your journey
                throughout Sinnoh, while Chimchar is likely to tbe the best in the
                long term due to games lackluster choice of Fire-Type Pokémon
                throughout the region. There are a lot of options when it comes to
                Water-Type Pokémon so unless you are particularly drawn to Piplup one
                of the other two starters will be a better option to get started in
                Sinnoh.

                At the end of the day your starter choice will have little impact on
                how you progress along on your journey as you will encounter countless
                other Pokémon that you may prefer because they are stronger or simply
                because you prefer how they look. Its a Pokémon game, it can be beaten
                with any combination of Pokémon if your willing to grind out exp.

            <p>
                Below are lists of the Pokémon exclusive to each version of the game,
                these Pokémon can
                <strong>only</strong>
                be found in their respective game but can be acquired through trading
                with other players. Your decision on which version of the game to
                purchased could be made based on which Pokémon you want to have access

            <h2>Graphic Comparison</h2>
            <p>
                Here is a video from GameSpot that goes over the graphical changes
                made from the original games. The video goes over areas from the start
                of the game up until you face the first gym leader of the game Roark
                of each generation. You can see that areas have not changed at all and
                have only been given quite the graphical upgrade.
